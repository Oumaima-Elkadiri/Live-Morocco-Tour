    "texte": "Morocco is the place where you can witness the four seasons as you travel From the green lands and snow-capped mountains In the north, to the palm oases and the Sahara desert in the south. A land of contrast, with a rich culture, history and spectacular landscapes. In addition, Morocco is the closest country in North Africa to Europe, 14 kilometres (9 miles) away from Spain, which makes it easier for travelers to enter the country."
